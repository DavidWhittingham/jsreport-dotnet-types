# jsreport-dotnet-types
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/sx90dahobt3dhr2f?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pofider/jsreport-dotnet-types)

This package includes strong types like `Configuration` or `RenderRequest` which are shared across the .net sdk for jsreport repositories. The releases of the package should match the type changes in jsreport itself. So if you use older jsreport, you should still be able to use the latest sdk just with matching release of `jsreport-dotnet-types`.
